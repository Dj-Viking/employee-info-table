## Installation
* To install this app, first <code>git clone</code> the repository to your preferred working directory
* Change directory into your repository folder
* Then run this shell script to install dependencies

  <code>npm install</code>

* Once dependencies are successfully installed. Make sure you have MySQL 8 installed onto your computer and have a legacy password set for the root user.

* Connect to the database via your shell with this command

  <code>mysql -u root -p</code>

  - enter your admin password if you need to, and then enter your legacy password you set at MySQL installation.

* If you're able to connect to the database, then you're ready to use this app! because you'll need that password to connect to that database on your local computer from within the code it self
* The video will show explicitly where you need to enter your password into the code itself but here's an example of what it will look like

 ```js script 
const mysql = require('mysql2');

const db = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  port: '3306',
  password: 'your legacy password goes here',
  database: 'employees_db'
});

module.exports = db;
```  

* Now you're __really__ ready for operation CRUD! üòé
